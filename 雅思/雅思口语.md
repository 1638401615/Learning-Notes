# Part1 

* 每个问题**3-5句话**

* 三类题，每类问三道

* 第一类永远是**必考题**：家乡、学习工作、住宿（周边环境）

  **住宿**

  Where are you living at the moment?

  > "I currently live in a dormitory on campus, which is a **four-person room with bunk beds and desks.** The room is equipped with air conditioning and a private bathroom, but the downside is that the floor is made of concrete without tiles. This makes the dormitory look outdated."

   What do you like about the area you're living in?

  >"I live in the center of the university campus, which makes it convenient for me to attend classes either on the east or west side. Additionally, there are shops and cafeterias near the dormitory, so it's very convenient for me to buy things or grab a meal."

   Do you know many other people who live nearby?

  >"I do not know many people living near my dormitory, as I had switched dormitories once due to having different schedules with my roommate. Currently, I reside on a different floor with students from another class, and there is no culture of visiting each other's dormitories, so I have little opportunity to get to know them."

  **学习**

   What do you study?

  >I am now studying for a degree in computer science. In short, this means that I learn a variety of  different coding languages, from C++ to Python. On top of this, we also learn how to implement these codes  towards profitable projects and how to utilize our skills in the business world. 

   Do you sometimes feel that you have to study too hard?

  >yes, I often feel like I have to work hard to study because I major in computer science and computer science is such a popular major that even students from other majors want to switch to it. As someone who is majoring in this field, I have to work even harder to ensure that I can find a job and not be replaced by students from other majors who might steal my job opportunities.

   What do you like to do just after you finish class every day?

  >After I finish class each day I like to meet up with my classmates and spend some time doing  activities in the city. While at class I find studying very isolating, so I like to do social things once I  am done with my classes. Most days we will either go out to a restaurant together or get a coffee in a  local café. Sometimes we do more exciting activities such as playing basketball or table tennis.

  **家乡**

## 家里舒服的某处地方 & 一个享受的生活习惯 & 理想房子/公寓 

家里最舒服的地方是我的balcony，那儿有个椅子可以躺着，我经常在学习很久感到疲惫后坐在那，或者在心情不好感到烦躁的时候去那儿休息一下放空自己。我躺在那儿的时候什么都不会想，只会看着窗外的山和河流，这能让我的内心平静下来。这个地方还能看到日出如果你起的够早的话，能看到太阳从山上出现，这些美好的景色着实会让人感到心情舒畅。btw，当我在家感到无聊，不知道做什么的时候我现在也会选择去窗台看风景，时间不知不觉就流逝了。

## 和小孩相处的时刻 & 教朋友或亲戚的时刻

* the last time I spent time with a young child may be the last summer vacation if my memory severs me right, and it took place  in my home.

* Before I went home from the college, I had known that my younger cousin was going to live in my home for several days. Because his mom wanted me to teach him how to study efficiently, as I am one of the best students in my family in terms of academic performance. After knowing this, I was really looking forward to it coz I had not saw my cousin for several months. I would like to play with the cute guy and was glad to teach him how to study. Before he came to my house, I had already recalled many study methods that I used during my high school years and planned to teach him

* Then when he came to my home, we really have a good time together. We studied together on the day and play games on the night. When we studied together, I would observe whether he is focused on learning and provide him with some efficient solutions when he asked me questions. Besides studying, I will also teach him what is good study habit he should follow and share some information about college majors which he is interested in.

* 教亲戚或朋友的时刻：how easy it was to teach him

## 受欢迎的人 & 乐于助人的人 & 想要一起工作/ 学习的人

* The most popular person I've ever met is probably my high school classmate Seth. He was the math class representative. I don't know if this concept exists in other countries. The class representative is responsible for collecting and distributing homework, sometimes helping the teacher mark the papers, and assisting classmates with subject-related issues. That sounds like teaching assistant in college.

* As a representative, he is very responsible. To better help us with math problems, he works hard to study math. And whenever you ask him questions, he will spare not effort to help you. He is a very patient guy, so you don't need to worry about being scolded by him for asking stupid questions. This greatly improve the atmosphere of learning mathematics in our class. Several students get higher score in math exam thanks for his help.

* He is not only helpful, but also keen to participate in class activities. I can still remember once there was a football math between classes, and our class didn't have enough people to participate. Despite not knowing how to paly football, he still joined the game. Many students took him as an example and actively participated in the competition.

* He is not only popular for his good personality, but also for his handsome appearance. So there are many girls would like to make friends with him. Who can say no to such a handsome guy with good personality?

* 乐于助人的人：explain why you think this person often help other people

  Partly because his parents have always taught him to do so, partly because he was born that way. 

* 想要一起工作/ 学习的人：

  we studied together for three years in high school.

  he really know how to comfort people when they are down. I once felt very depressed after failing a exam, he just come and carefully help me analyze the reason I failed the exam and give me many useful tips to solve the problems. After his analysis, I regained my confidence and do well in the next exam.

  How can you don't want to study with such a good guy?

* 汽车旅行：

  the car journey took place in Diqing, Yunnan Province last summer vacation.

* I went there with my friends in middle school. It may sounds a bit surprising. Because xxxxxxx

* We joined a small tour group which we made up the majority of the group. The tour guide drove us to visit different attractions around the city. We all felt fortunate that we made the decision to join the tour group coz there were almost no public transportation, we didn't even see a taxi in the city. I can't image how can we travel so many attractions without a car.

* The journey took three days and the last day is most interesting. The tour guide took us to his home that day. We visit his home and had a meal there. I should say it is the best meal in my three days journey. After lunch, his family told us about some local customs and traditions here. They also showed us some local specialties(特产). I have never been to a local's home   through a tour group. So it's very impressive for me.

* 有趣工作：

  I think being a tour guide can be quite interesting, coz you can meet different kinds of people everyday and you may make friends with a lot of them. I like making friends. Besides, you can travel to tourisms every day, may be you will get tired of some tourisms, but for those with  beautiful sceneries, you will never get bored not matter how many times you see them.

You have to interact with many people every day, and learn how to communicate better with them will not only improve the customer experience which will benefit you career a lot, but also make you own work easier and more enjoyable.

*  短暂停留：

  what would you like to do there?

   In the first few days, I will go to some famous attractions and restaurants there. These two things are essential in every trip I take. Then after those days of travelling, I would like to live as locals to experience the lifestyle in this city. It's said that the lifestyle there is low-paced and relaxed compared to that in big cities. I truly want to try it myself. And if there are still some time, I may learn something about the culture and history there.

  After all these is done, I will leave the city coz the sun is very hot in that place and it's easy to get a tan and even a sunburn here without lotion(防晒霜). And the altitude there is over one thousand meters, I may not be able to adapt life in such high altitude.

* 人山人海之地：

  there is nothing different in this place but it's a tourism so there are many peoples every day, especially in vacations like summer vacation when I went there. 

  There are several feelings in my mind when I saw so many people. One is that **the more tourists there are, the more worth visiting the place is**, this idea made me more excited about the travelling.  But there are also many bad effects. For example , too many people there greatly

* 冒险：

  If there is an adventure I would like to take in the future. I think it may be snowboarding from the top of the ski slope without falling.

  To achieve this, I need to go to somewhere with ski area first. I think Changbai Mountain in Jilin Province is a good choice coz the ski area there is well-known through out the country. I believe the good ski area will be helpful for my learning.

* The construction of these buildings is still ongoing, and I don't know how long it will need to complete, may be one more year or less.
* Before the construction, it was a small village on the border of the urban area and countryside. Due to the government's plan, this village was demolished and abandoned long time ago. However, it wasn't until two years ago that they started to build new buildings here.
* As the construction began, the air was no longer clean any more, if you open the window, you would find that the air is mixed with lots of dust which you can easily see on the surface of every furniture.
* The other problem is the noise problem, although they are forced to stop when it's late at night. You can still be affect by them during the day, especially when you want to focus on study or something else need concentration. And if you don't take a nap at specific time in the afternoon, you will also be disturbed by the noise.

* They are produced by a company which will spend far more time on ad than the game itself.
